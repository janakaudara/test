    <p>The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain files not tracked by Git remain untracked. To stop tracking a file that is 
        currently tracked, use git rm --cached to remove the file from the index. The filename can then be added to the .gitignore file to stop 
        the file from being reintroduced in later commits.</p>
